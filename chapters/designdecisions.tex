\section{Design Decisions}
%% Contents
% Document all important design decisions and their reasons!

%%Motivation
% It is advantageous if all important design decisions can be found in one place. It is up to 
% you to decide if a decision should be documented here or rather locally (e.g. in the white 
% box descriptions of building blocks). In any case avoid redundancies.
